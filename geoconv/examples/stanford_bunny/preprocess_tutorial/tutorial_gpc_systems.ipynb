    "## Theoretical Background on Surface Patches\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we already mentioned the *patch opeartor* $[D_w(\\textbf{u})s](\\textbf{v})$. Combining the theory about intrinsic surface convolutions from [1] with the framework for non-Euclidean convolutions proposed in [2] allows us to define the patch operator as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[D_w(\\textbf{u})s](\\textbf{v}) = \\underset{B_R(\\textbf{0})}{\\int} w_\\textbf{v}(\\textbf{y})[s \\circ \\text{exp}_\\textbf{u} \\circ \\omega_\\textbf{u}](\\textbf{y})\\ d\\textbf{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The patch operator's goal is to **interpolate and extract local surface information** which can be used within the intrinsic surface convolution. It contains three main components:\n",
    "- A signal $s(\\cdot)$\n",
    "- A prior $w_\\bullet(\\cdot)$\n",
    "- A patch $[\\text{exp}_\\bullet \\circ \\omega_\\bullet](\\cdot)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The signal\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we can approximate continuous surfaces with triangle meshes. In doing so, we restrict the signal $s(\\cdot)$ to be defined on the mesh's vertices. The selection of an appropriate signal is up to the user. The literature typically uses shape descriptors such as *SHOT descriptors* [2, 3] or *optimal shape desriptors* [4, 5]. Our experiments have shown that normalized 3D coordinates can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The prior\n",
    "\n",
    "The patch operator does not simply extract a signal value at a point on the surface. It *interpolates* the signal at a point of interest. For this, we need to define some sort of interpolation coefficients. Interpolation coefficients tell how much neighboring vertices contribute to the signal at the point of interest. That is, given a point of interest $\\textbf{y}$, $w_\\bullet(\\textbf{y})$ defines a function that tells how much neighboring vertices contribute additionally to the surface signal at $\\textbf{y}$. A good choice should pay attention to local surface structure, which can be considered *prior information*. Hence the name. The literature typically uses priors that are proportional to the normal distribution [2, 4, 6]. However, you're not restricted to normal distributions. GeoConv allows you to define arbitrary priors. But this exceeds the scope of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The patch\n",
    "\n",
    "A patch $[\\text{exp}_\\textbf{u} \\circ \\omega_\\textbf{u}](\\cdot)$ can simply be thought of as an *extracted local area element* of the triangle mesh with center vertex $\\textbf{u}$. Let's take a closer look on the *frame* (or gauge) $\\omega_\\textbf{u}$ and the *exponential map* $\\text{exp}_\\textbf{u}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *A short side-note to avoid confusion:* The exponential map is not meant as in \"*e to the power of ...*\". It is a local diffeomorphism $\\text{exp}_\\textbf{u}: T_\\textbf{u} M^n \\rightarrow M^n$ from a tangent space to the underlying manifold. This mapping appears a lot in differential geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Euclidean convolution on images we need to know the relative positions between image pixels. These are simply given by subtracting the indices (or coordinates) of the pixels. When working with meshes, we use *tangent vectors* as a local notion for relative positions between surface points since subtraction for surface points is not defined. However, tangent vectors are coordinate free in general. This is why we are required to define *some* frame $\\omega_\\textbf{u}$ that associates coordinates with tangent vectors and has its origin in surface point $\\textbf{u}$. Be aware that there is no unique frame in general. For example, a chosen frame can be arbitrarly rotated and each rotation yields another frame which adequatly describes local surface information. This ambiguity problem is often times referred to as **angular coordinate ambiguity** [1, 2, 4, 6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a frame $\\omega_\\textbf{u}$ centered in surface point $\\textbf{u}$, we can map a tangent vector $\\omega_\\textbf{u}(\\textbf{y})$ onto a surface point with the exponential map $\\text{exp}_\\textbf{u}(\\omega_\\textbf{u}(\\textbf{y}))$. The exponential map is limited by the so called **injectivity radius** $R$. Surface points which lie farther than $R$ to the origin will be mapped on coordinates which are already assigned to other surface points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we select a mesh vertex $\\textbf{v}_k$ and compute *geodesic polar coordinates* $(\\rho, \\theta)$ for all triangle mesh vertices $\\textbf{v}_l$ which have a maximal geodesic distance of $\\rho_{\\text{max}}$ to $\\textbf{v}_k$. We refer to the set of all computed coordinates for a center vertext $\\textbf{v}_k$ as a *local geodesic polar coordinate system* (**GPC-system**). The computation of a GPC-system can be done in multiple ways. For example, [4] uses a modified fast marching method. GeoConv, in contrast, implements the algorithm of [7] (if you're intersted, check `compute_gpc_systems`).\n",
    "\n",
    "> That is, if we want to retrieve mesh vertex $\\text{exp}_{\\textbf{v}_k}(\\omega_{\\textbf{v}_k}(\\rho, \\theta))$ we \"enter\" the pre-computed coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta)$ into the GPC-system that has its center in $\\textbf{v}_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to compute GPC-systems\n",
    "\n",
    "From the theory we know that we must consider the following two aspects to avoid computing degenerated GPC-systems:\n",
    "1. **Injectivity Radius**: The injectivity radius is the maximal extension of a local GPC-system\n",
    "2. **Angular Coordinate Ambiguity**: The angular coordinate ambiguity refers to the ambiguity in the selection of a reference direction within a local GPC-system. Where is 0° in our GPC-system?\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoConv provides you with the necessary algorithms and data structures to compute the GPC-systems. While the provided functions take care of defining a reference direction, which alleviates from thinking about the *angular coordinate ambiguity problem*, you still need to think about what maximal radius your GPC-systems can have. Here are two \"rules\" that you should consider when elaborating on that question:\n",
    "1. The maximal radius should not be **smaller** then the **largest** one-hop neighborhood distance of the vertices from your normalized mesh\n",
    "2. The maximal radius should not be **larger** then the **smallest** injectivity radius of your normalized meshes\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we use the following rule of thumb:\n",
    "- Let the largest one-hop neighborhood distance in your dataset of **all** meshes be given by $r$\n",
    "- Set the maximal radius for **all** GPC-systems to: $R = r * \\alpha$ for $\\alpha > 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "While definetly not being a perfect choice, this ensures that you will not violate the first rule. However, be aware that you might get degenerate GPC-systems in meshes at places where $R$ exceeds the injectivity radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code-box calculates multiple GPC-systems of different size for a single origin. Configure `vertex_idx`, `amt_alphas` and `largest_alpha` yourself.\n",
